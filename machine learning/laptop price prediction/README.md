üñ•Ô∏è Laptop Price Prediction and Analysis üìä

Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction and Analysis project! This repository demonstrates the application of Machine Learning techniques to analyze laptop specifications and predict their prices. The project also includes an in-depth data preprocessing pipeline, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training for regression tasks.

üöÄ Project Highlights

üìÇ Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 877 entries and 18 features, including laptop specifications like brand, processor type, RAM, storage, and display details.
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and scaling numeric data for modeling.

‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Techniques

Supervised Machine Learning: Focused on regression to predict continuous target values (e.g., price).
Exploratory Data Analysis: Extracted insights from features like rating, brand, and processor generation to identify patterns.
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features, removed irrelevant data, and ensured data quality for better predictions.
Model Building: Applied and compared various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to achieve high accuracy.

üí° Key Features
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Handled missing values and optimized data for machine learning by dropping irrelevant rows and features.
Replaced invalid or inconsistent values with appropriate methods to maintain data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between laptop specs (RAM, storage, display size) and price.
Identified top-performing brands based on customer ratings and specs.
Model Training & Evaluation

Built regression models to predict laptop prices with high accuracy.
Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R2 score, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Actionable Insights from Data

Insights into the most cost-effective brands and configurations for specific user needs.
Identified key factors that significantly affect laptop prices, enabling targeted decision-making.
