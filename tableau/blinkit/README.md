Blinkit Data Analysis and Dashboard

Project Overview<br>
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit sales data and developing a Power BI dashboard with key metrics and insights. The raw data was pre-processed in Python (Pandas), enabling smooth integration and visualization for impactful decision-making.

Objectives<br>
Clean raw sales data for accuracy and consistency using Pandas.<br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover sales trends, outliers, and patterns.<br>
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to display key insights on sales, outlet performance, and item categories.<br>
Deliver actionable metrics like total sales, top-performing outlets, and category trends.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas): Data cleaning and preparation.
Power BI: Visualization and dashboard development.
Jupyter Notebook: For performing data analysis and cleaning steps.

Key Features<br>
